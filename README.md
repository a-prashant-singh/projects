# Simple Bank project

I used Email-Api to send your confidential credentials directly to your email ID.
(Ex: - Customer ID, Account Number, Your default password).

When you get your credentials via email you can change your password what do you want.

After changing your password, you can access your account. But if you do not use your account for more than 15 minutes, it will automatically log out. Then again you will have to access your account with the OTP.

Now Admin can see the customerâ€™s list, he can edit, delete, and add customers.

For building this project we used HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript for front-end purposes only, In the back-end we used JSP, Servlet, Hibernate, and Spring MVC.
