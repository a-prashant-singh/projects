# Simple Bank project

Used Email-Api for sending your confidential credentials directly to your email Id.
(Ex: - Customer Id, Account Number, Your default password).

When you got your credentials via email you can change your password what do you want.

After changing your password, you can access your account. But if you not use your account more than 15 minutes then it will get automatically logout. Then again you will have to access your account with the OTP.

Now Admin can see the customerâ€™s list, he can edit, delete, add customer.

For building this project we used html, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript for front-end purpose only, In the back-end we used JSP, Servlet, Hibernate Spring MVC.
